# GraphiQueue
Queue Graphic Implementation is a visual learning project that demonstrates different types of queues including linear, circular, priority, and deque. It graphically explains queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, peek, overflow, and underflow, making queue concepts easy to understand for learners.

PROGRAM FEATURES
-----------------
1.LEARN MODE (TEXT-BASED INTRODUCTION)
.Each queue type (Linear, Circular, Priority, Input Restricted Deque, Output Restricted Deque) has a Learn Mode.
.This mode explains:
.What the queue is
.Terminologies like Front, Rear, Priority
.Operations (Enqueue, Dequeue, etc.)
.Real-world applications
.The Learn Mode runs in the console and educates the user before performing any operation.

2.GRAPHICS MODE (VISUAL OPERATION DISPLAY)
.The main feature of the project is visualizing queue operations using "graphics.h" with the WinBGIm graphics library.
.A separate graphics window opens for each queue type.
.Visual effects include:
.Boxes representing elements of the queue.
.Arrows pointing to Front and Rear.
.Live updates when operations like Enqueue, Dequeue, etc., are performed.
.Priority Queue displays both elements and their priorities in separate sections.
.Circular Queue elements are drawn in a circular layout.
.Double Ended Queues show insertion and deletion options at both ends.
.Each queue type has a custom graphical representation.

HOW TO RUN
-----------
1. Run the program:
   ./queues.exe
2. A Command Prompt menu appears.
3. Select:
   1. Linear Queue
   2. Circular Queue
   3. Priority Queue
   4. Double Ended Queue
      - Input Restricted Deque
      - Output Restricted Deque
4. User can either opt for operation mode or learn according to their choice and need
6. Each queue opens its own graphics window for visualization.
